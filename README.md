# hello-world
# My journey to R and understanding the GitHub Flow
My name is Richard and I am excited to embark on this data mining journey and absorb every bit of knowledge it has to offer!
My past experiences have honed my skills in describing situations, predicting events, and prescribing solutionsâ€”fostering a keen interest in descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive statistics, respectively. I'm eager to leverage this course to further enhance my ability to handle and manage data effectively.
